## OpenCV
OpenCV is an Open Source Computer Vision Library used for machine learning for performing real-time operations
With OpenCV, you can do many things
- Face Detection
- Face Recognition
- Object Recognition
- Motion Tracking
- Mobile Robotics
- Statistical machine learning

There are many more functionalities and it can be used for security, emergency , verification , advance ticketing systems and many many more purposes.
You can find more on officail site of [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

## Face Detection Vs Face Recognition
Face detection and face recognition may look very similar, but in reality, they are not the same. Let’s understand the difference so as not to miss the point.

Face detection is the process of detecting faces, from an image or a video does not matter. The program does nothing more than finding the faces. But on the other hand in the task of face recognition, the program finds faces and can also tell which face belongs to which. So it’s more informative than just detecting them. There is more programming, in other words, more training in the process.

Let’s say you are looking at the street and the cars are passing. Face detection is like saying the passing object is a car. And facial recognition is like being able to tell the model of the passing car. Here is a nice picture showing the difference in practice.

## Installation

Run in Shell

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
## Code
Make a Python file and execute the following code:

- For Image: [Script1](https://github.com/officialAmanchauhan/FaceIT/blob/main/script.py)
- For Video/Web Cam: [Script2](https://github.com/officialAmanchauhan/FaceIT/blob/main/script2.py)

That's just one simple example, we can use OpenCV in many different ways

Have a Great Day
